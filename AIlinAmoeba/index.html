               <p>There was a creature living secretly inside human body. Its planet was one of those numerous cells, and the body was its whole universe. No one knew about it. It was too small to be seen under scans, and when people got blood samples, it ran away. 
                    Its existence had no significance. All it could do was to automatically swallow a virus when the temperature inside went up, but it didn’t know why.
                    It had thinking abilities, and it often doubted the meaning of life watching the permanently dark night sky.
                    Life like this ended when people invented the shrinking machine. I, as the first scientist who used the shrinking machine shrank myself and decided to enter a human’s body. 
                    I eventually discovered this kind of creature and named it after myself. I found this creature transparent and could change its shape according to its own will. So it’s an amoeba.
                    I took out some chemicals I carried and tried to interact with it.
                    Surprisingly as I injected a type of green chemical to it, it didn’t turn green but grew bigger. While the blue one made it jump and accidentally release the virus and the pink one made it change its color randomly. 
                    Its potential was found and it was very happy. So it released (electrical) current. I felt it and used another machine to transfer it into human language, so that we could communicate. I told it that its ability of catching virus 
                    actually helped the whole universe and another enormous creature got healthier. AilinAmoeba was so delighted that the current was so strong, even other amoebas in the multi-universe(other human’s bodies)received the current. They found their existence meaningful and lived a happy life since.

                       <p>1.observe the amoeba when the body temperature goes up
                2.click the mouse several times and observe the changes of the amoeba and body temperature
